Hot molecule project implement a coupled cluster
approach to simulated thermal vibronic problem.

This approach mainly consistent of two parts:

1. thermal field theory:
By introducing ancillary space and Bogliubov transformation,
we could form a thermal field reference state as well as
bosonic construction operator that is single-reference like.

2. coupled cluster theory:
On top of the thermal field reference state, we formulation a
single reference like coupled cluster equation and thermal properties
could be simulation through imaginary time integration of
coupled cluster equation of motion
